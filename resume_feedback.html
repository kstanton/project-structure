  <!-- Uh oh! missing body tag! 

       Why did the document work or why did it validate, you're 
       probably asking. Apparently, HTML5 does not require head, body
       tags. However, designers are not straying away from using these
       as best practice. It's a matter of organization, in the same way
       we use structural tags.

    <h1>Katherine Stanton</h1>
    <img src="img/headshot.jpg" alt="Katherine Stanton Headshot" height="300" width="200">

    <!-- Something to consider: a descriptive filename. What you have done is
         absolutely fine. The thinking behind this is if someone comes across
         your image without the context of a web page. For instance:

         kate_stanton_portrait.jpg

         Certainly nothing major in this sense, but maybe something as you
         build bigger sites.

         Adding height and width shouldn't be necessary because it can be 
         taken care of using CSS. 

         Don't forget 'img' tags are self-closing.

    <!-- Good job using section tag. I'm not sure how much you read up
         on these tags, but they are very flexible and can be used
         within other structural tags.

         Good job wrapping /everything/ in the address, too. That is 
         actually how it is supposed to be used - - to wrap all
         contact information related to the document! :)

         The values for each anchor are good, especially because they

         offsite - - you can do it, but it tends to indicate distrust 
         in the user. Will they come back? Most sites, when linking off 
         site, do not have a new window/tab open. Of course, this is a 
         largely theoretical debate, but worth noting for you to 
         consider.
